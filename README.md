## Week 0 - Scratch
For the problem set 0 project, I created a game using Scratch called ["Snake Game"](https://scratch.mit.edu/).  
These are the instructions for the game:

> **Snake Game!**  
> Control a snake to eat food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls and itself.  
> 
> **Key Binds:**
> - 🔼 Up Arrow – Move Up
> - 🔽 Down Arrow – Move Down
> - ▶️ Right Arrow – Move Right
> - ◀️ Left Arrow – Move Left
